Public Git repo created for the coding tasks required as part of application for GRA position under Prof. Leroy.


https://github.com/sky9519/StanfordNLPdemo/blob/main/my-app/src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java is the main java file used to perform the tasks required.
I studied and used guidance from various sources to implement the NLP solution since I didn't have prior experience with NLP.
For Task 1: Using StanfordNLP to print out the number of lines, characters and nouns in a txt file, I used DKPro Core.

About DKPro Core:
DKPro Core is a collection of NLP components, wrapped as UIMA components. 
It includes the Stanford CoreNLP components, and there is a tutorial on how to use them in the DKPro Core documentation. 
DKPro Core is part of the DKPro community. It is well-maintained and our recommended way of using Stanford CoreNLP within UIMA. 
DKPro Core was principally developed by Richard Eckart de Castilho at the Ubiquitous Processing Lab (UKP) at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.

For Task 2, I used HTML and JavaScript to take user input using the form element and perform basic validation using Javascript to not allow submissions.
Currently, my backend is not connected to the frontend but I will connect both of them using RESTful API soon.
https://github.com/sky9519/StanfordNLPdemo/blob/main/index.html is the index file for the webpage.


Thanks!
